# WP Interlude

This is a plugin which checks specific resource links on your pages to see if the resource is available yet. Until it's available it will display a waiting message of your choosing.

## CAUTION: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

I am but one lonely developer, and this is free software.
This plugin has not been vetted by WordPress and is still very much in development.
I can't gurantee this will work perfectly in all scenarios, so don't yell at me if it breaks! :)
